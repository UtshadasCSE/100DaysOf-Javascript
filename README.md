The problem with JavaScript is that you have to choose to use it. You can't embed it in a page and expect people to run it by default. It has to be requested explicitly. This means it is only used when someone knows about it and wants to use it.

No matter how powerful a programming language is, there are not enough programmers in the world who understand it well enough or care enough about its problems to use it by default. There are too many other languages that are easier to use, safer, and more powerful than JavaScript.

JavaScript is fast and lightweight, making it easy to prototype apps without the need for backend development. It has become a core skill for any professional developer, not just those specializing in front-end development.

The popularity of JavaScript is only growing with the rise of Node.js, which allows developers to create server-side applications in JavaScript.


<h2 align="center">A brief history of how JavaScript became popular</h2>

JavaScript was first developed in August 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications. It became a standard of the ECMA International standards organization in 1997 and peaked its popularity in the late 1990s when it began to be used for client-side scripting.

Towards the end of the 1990s and into the early 2000s, JavaScript's popularity declined due to browser upgrades, allowing it to run on the server-side. However, Node.js revived JavaScript as a server-side language around 2009.

The web development community has noticed a rise in the popularity of JavaScript since then, with new frameworks and tools being created or updated over time to work with it. It is currently one of the most popular programming languages among developers and has grown in demand and popularity.

JS is a scripting language that allows developers to build interactive elements on websites. It was originally used to make web pages more interactive and fun. JavaScript also helped reduce the time it took for a browser to load because it helped developers remove some of the load-time scripting languages and tools used before JS.

The spread of JavaScript can be attributed to its portability. It is a lightweight scripting language embedded in a webpage through HTML. This means that JavaScript code can be linked to elements on a page, like text boxes or buttons, which the program can then manipulate.

Trouble cropped up when developers attempted to use JavaScript for larger projects. In 2004, John Resig released the first version of jQuery, an open-source library designed to make coding with JavaScript easier. The library made it possible for users to easily make changes across multiple browsers because it only relied on HTML and CSS rather than custom code. This helped solve some issues with cross-browser compatibility, but it still wasn't enough for many developers who were used to more robust programming languages like C++ or Java.
